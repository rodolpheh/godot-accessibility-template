# Godot Accessibility Plugin Template

A simple project that enables the [godot-accessibility](https://github.com/rodolpheh/godot-accessibility) plugin out of the box.

## How to use?

Just pull the repository and its submodules and open the project in Godot (this project was made with Godot 4.1):

```bash
# Pull the source code
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/rodolpheh/godot-accessibility-template.git

# Open with Godot
godot godot-accessibility-template/project.godot
```

Once started, text-to-speech should be enabled and reading from Godot's interface. Please refer to the [godot-accessibility README](https://github.com/rodolpheh/godot-accessibility/blob/master/README.md) to know more about controls and how it works.
